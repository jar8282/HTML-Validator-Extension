# html-validator README

This extension is going to scan an html document, and use the W3C [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
It is my first VS-Code extension, please bear with any mistakes as I get used to working with it.

## Extension Settings

### Placeholder txt for possible settings:

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## PLANNED 1.0.0

Initial release of the HTML Validator extension

## PLANNED 2.0.0

I plan to switch the extension from using the W3C html validator for an offline, built in version: full re-work.
